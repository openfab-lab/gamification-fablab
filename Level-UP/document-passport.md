It's farely easy, create a document ([Markdown](create-md.md) for example) in your own [repository](create-repo.md), name it following our [naming convention](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/blob/891cee5a70a51c7256b687a5971c4697ffca2d10/xx-src/naming-convention.md). Then build your own tutorial, explain what you think is important to explain, your choices, the techniques you used, ... It's up to you.
