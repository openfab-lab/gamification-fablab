# How to create your GitHub profile?

Having a few difficulties to create your GitHub profile? Here's a guide to help to do so :)

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) homepage, click on "Sign Up"  
2. Go through step 1. and fill in the 3 different boxes.  
3. Go through step 2. "Choose your personal plan", tick "Unlimited public repositories for free." 
OpenFab is an opensource project so everything we do is public. To know more, click [here].
4. Go through step 3. or just skip it.  
5. Click on "View profile and more" (small pic on the top right), then click on "Your profile", finally click on "Edit profile".
