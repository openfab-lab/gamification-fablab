# How to create your first issue?

You have learned a few GitHub basics features, now let's discover "Issues"! This will be the opportunity for you to present
yourself to OpenFab's community.

1. Go to OpenFab repository : [openfab-lab/openfab](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab)

2. Optional, but recommended, click on "Watch", the button with an eye, on the top right. This way you'll get 
notified when something new happen in the repository. Then click on "Star", the button with a ... star :pensive: 
(sorry, still working on having my "Humour" badge). This way the repo will be easy to find on your profile.

3. Click on "Issues" and then on "New issue".

***Let's make a short break*** (you deserve it, you might be tired after clicking on something like 2 or 3 buttons!).  
> What are **Issues**?  
Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. 
They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of the community, of your team. 
(Almost) any information, problem, idea, solution, etc. will enter in your repository through this door.  

4. As you can see in the picture above, we added an automated template for our issues. 
This is supposed to guide you writing them. This template will be detailed in our guidelines for [Contributing](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), 
we strongly advice you to read it. This explains clearly how you can contribute to OpenFab.

_Title_ can be something like : "Presentation - your name"  
_Context_ can be on who you are, where you come from, your area of expertise, ...  
_Objective_ can be focus on your project, what you want to accomplish at OpenFab, in the community.  
_Proposition_ can be focus on how you think you'll proceed to conduct your project.  
...  

But feel free to adapt it to your situation. This is the first version of this template, it might evolve with practice.
We are found of "Quick and dirty", "Better is better than perfect", iteration and currently, this is good enough for us.

Has written, issues support Markdown's formatting syntax so if you need some help on this point, 
go back to the previous step: "[How to create a markdown document?](create-md.md)" 
or check this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

5. You can click on "Submit new issue", you will discover the other functions later or by reading this 
[tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) if you are too curious.  

You are almost a SuperUser, as if you were a SuperHero but not exactly. Keep going, you are close!  

Next step is:
